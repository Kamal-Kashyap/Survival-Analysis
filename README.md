# Survival-Analysis
Neural Approach to Survival Analysis with  Interval-Censored Observations Using Deep Learning Model

The main goal of this work is to create a strong survival analysis model using deep 
learning, based on the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. Traditional methods like the 
Cox proportional hazards model make strict assumptions about how factors affect survival 
time, which may not work well with real-world data that involves complex or changing 
patterns over time. The deep learning approach based on AFT provides more flexibility by 
directly predicting survival time, making it useful when these assumptions donâ€™t hold
